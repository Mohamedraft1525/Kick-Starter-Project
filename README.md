# Kick-Starter-Project
This Power BI project analyzes Kickstarter campaigns from two CSV files (2016, 2018). It includes data transformation using Power Query, creating custom hierarchies, and calculating key measures (e.g., Number of Projects, Backers, Total Pledged). Visualizations highlight project distribution by state, category, and country.
